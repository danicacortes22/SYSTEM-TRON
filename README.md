COVID19-Case Surveillance Public Use Data

# Introduction

COVID-19 is the country's worst public health catastrophe in a century, and timely and reliable surveillance data are critical for informing prevention initiatives, health policies, and resource allocations for local and national responses.COVID-19 is the country's worst public health catastrophe in a century, and timely and reliable surveillance data are critical for informing prevention initiatives, health policies, and resource allocations for local and national responses.

As the pandemic progressed and the need for long-term national case surveillance data became apparent, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) built on the existing National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), which has been providing case surveillance data for decades. The US response has been guided in identifying disproportionately afflicted communities based on continuing analysis of national COVID-19 case surveillance data. Data from case surveillance has been used to track illness occurrence, identify underlying medical issues linked to the disease, and provide prevention advice.

Summarizing the aim, constraints, and completeness of nationalCOVID-19 case surveillance data may aid in their interpretation and help improve the data over time.

# Statement of the Problem

This study was carried out to analyze Covid-19 data, which may help us determine how cases and surveillance improve from time to time in the midst of the pandemic.

The following questions will be the sole focus of this research:

1.) What exactly is a covid-19 case, including a "probable case?"

2.) How important is data tracker in determining covid-19 cases on a regular basis?

3.) How can data sources support in the gathering of information on Covid-19 cases?

4.) What are the limitations of using case surveillance data to gather information on Covid-19 cases?


# Significance of the Problem 

The present study is significant to the following personnel involved in the system of the Alitagtag, Batangas:

To the Government, this will be used as the  medium to help officials understand where, when, and in which populations an illness is transmitted.

To the Public Health Office, this study will be a good way to meet the goal of the hospitals, healthcare providers and laboratories. 

To the patients, it will help them to protect from infectious diseases especially the COVID-19 and other health threats. 

To the future researchers, they will be benefited with the study because there will be another reference for their future research.



# Expected Output

The expected output of our topic entitled COVID19-Case Surveillance Public Use Data. 

As the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, routine identification and dissemination of priority COVID-19 public health science questions can promote efforts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health partners to fill critical scientific gaps and inform evidence-based decision-making through public health surveillance and epidemiologic research. 

The priority questions outline the critical scientific gaps identified by the CDC COVID-19 Response, CDC programs, and other public health partners that, if addressed, could provide significant, timely, and measurable improvements in public health outcomes.
